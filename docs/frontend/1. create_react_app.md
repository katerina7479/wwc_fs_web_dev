* Setting up a React Frontend

** Goals:
Create a react app in a client directory
Run client locally on localhost:3000 (it will hit the api at 8000)


** Developing
1. Run `npx create-react-app client` from the root of the directory: [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/]
2. `cd client && npm run start`

Modify client/src code!

** Production:

Build the React app, and deploy the build to a static file hosting service (S3)
