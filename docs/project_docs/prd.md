# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Product Overview

We are going to start creating an open source restuarant delivery service that restaurants can host themselves and open
up for clients to make online orders. 

## Target Audience

We anticipate that any restuarant who is tired of paying the exorbitant fees associated with delivery services like
Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats, etc. may consider hosting their own app. Open source will allow independent developers to
create frontend mobile apps, delivery apps, and other services independent of the large chains. End users may also
appreciate having a closer connection / interactions and support of their local restaurants. 

## User Needs

User would like to order delivery food from a variety of restaurants, see the menu, and pay the same way at each restaurant. 
Restaurant Manager would like to manage their locations, menus, and schedule themselves. 

## Features

* Admin Client (Frontend)
  * Enter Menus
  * Multi-menu
  * Multi-location
  * Schedule by location
  * Receive & Confirm Orders
  * Calculate tips
* API
* Search for restaurants (Nice to have)
  
## Out of Scope
* Restaurants to start by Managing Delivery themselves
* Restaurant Responsible to pay the driver
* Customer Service handled by restaurant
* User Client (separate initiative)
* Delivery Client (separate initiative)
* Payments (requires more research / feedback)
